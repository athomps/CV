# CV
Latex files for curriculum vitae.
I customized make_cv.sh for my OS X latex installation.
To run it:

./make_cv.sh

I generates a lot of error messages, but it works.

To clean up and start over:

rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.log CV.out CV.pdf

To generate the file vita_2020.txt, I opened vita_2020.doc
in MS Word, did Save As, chose plain text and UTF-16 encoding.
But it's not worth redoing, because original Word doc is riddled with
errors and inconsistencies.
